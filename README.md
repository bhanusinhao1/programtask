Basics of JavaScript and HTML were used in order to input data from user and store it in a text file and a submit button was added to confirm the entry of data. Basic validation of text field such as no empty field (null-text) were implemented. For file storage, a blob object was used.
Once the code is run, the browser will open a pop-up window with the downloadable text file that will contain the user input data. This text file can be used as input for the Java program to perform certain tasks as described in the tasks.

The data.txt file contains the sample input made (first test case).
The UserDataEntry.html file contains the HTML and JS code for user data entry and storage of the data.
